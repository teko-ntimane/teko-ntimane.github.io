### Work Experience
**Data Scientist @ Efficio Consulting Limitied** (Mar 2024 - Present)<br>
_Lisbon, Portugal_
- Engineered a transformative DAG, processing monthly orders with advanced flagging and confidence scoring mechanisms, driving an increase in client savings and precision in order queries through the use of AWS, Python and SQL.
- Successfully implemented the migration of database private keys to AWS Parameter Store, enhancing security and streamlining the data teamâ€™s team workflows.
- Automated large dataset processing for global teams, reducing analysis time from 1 day for 50% processing of 1 file to under 1 day for 100% processing of 4 files and additional analytics, resulting in actionable insights.

**Data Analyst @ Yoco Technologies** (Apr 2022 - Mar 2024)<br>
_Cape Town, South Africa_
- Used data modeling and SQL to dramatically reduce order cancellation rates from 83% to 5% within 2 weeks, achieving cost savings exceeding 300,000 ZAR (approx. 15,000 EUR).
- (R&D team member:) Redefined business customer segmentation rules using advanced clustering techniques and feature engineering, which served as a cornerstone for tracking OKRs.
- Maintained and developed the Customer Acquisition Cost model, enabling merchant-specific payback analysis and enhancing insights into acquisition costs across different merchant types, supporting strategic reporting to Exco and shareholders.
- Supported Customer Operations, Logistics and Commercial teams by delivering critical insights through developing and maintaining dashboards, conducting user journey mappings, and implementing data SQL modeling primarily using DBT. This support enabled teams to track key metrics and OKRs effectively, driving informed decision-making and operational improvements.
- Conducted an exploratory capacity modeling analysis using statistical techniques to determine the optimal number of customer support resources needed, preventing potential bottlenecks and ensuring efficient operations.
- Migrated a monthly acquisition target model from Google Sheets to DBT, addressing scalability and maintenance challenges. The original model required frequent manual updates and was time-consuming. By automating 90% of the process, I streamlined operations, reducing manual input significantly, and provided the Commercial team with the ability to forecast acquisitions for several months in advance.
